;;; Commentary:

;; The `cursor-in-brackets-mode` is a minor mode
;; that moves a cursor in brackets/quotes
;; when a right bracket/quote is inserted after a left bracket/quote.
;; Supported brackets and quotes are listed in the following.

;; - ()
;; - {}
;; - []
;; - <>
;; - ""
;; - ''
;; - `'
;; - ``
;; - $$

;; The `cursor-in-brackets-mode` also supports region-based bracketing.
;; When a right bracket is inserted with a `transient-mark-mode` region,
;; the region becomes bracketed and the cursor is moved before the right bracket.
;; When a left bracket is inserted instead,
;; the region becomes bracketed and the cursor is moved after the left bracket.

;;; Usage:

;;     (require 'cursor-in-brackets)
;;     (global-cursor-in-brackets-mode 1)
